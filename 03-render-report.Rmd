# Generate the report

After carefully setting your parameters, you can now generate your report!

There are three ways to generate reports:

1. Generate one report for one measure using the default settings `render_report()`

2. Generate one report for one measure using customized settings by the users `render_report_manual()`

3. Generate multiple separate reports for multiple measures using default settings `render_report_multiple()`

After generating the report, make sure to rename it and manually edit the sections that are text-heavy. The renaming is **necessary** because you may accidentally overwrite your manual edits if you regenerate the report in R.

Rmarkdown is not powerful yet to allow back-translation from Word to R codes, so your manual changes in Word will **NOT** be reflected in the R codes when you regenerate the report for some reasons (e.g. wrong file names). So we recommend finalizing the tables and plots before you write texts in the Word document (or you can just store the texts in another and move them over to the master report whenever you feel ready).

## `render_report()`

Run `?render_report()` to see what each argument represents.

Example:

```
render_report(input_dir = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test",
              template = "input_template_lebanon_cs.xlsx",
              index = "lebanon_cs",
              title = "Lebanon Year 1 (2016-2017)",
              output_dir = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test")
```

This function renders one report for the specified measure.

## `render_report_manual()`

Run `?render_report_manual()` to see what each argument represents.

Example:

```
render_report_manual(index = "lebanon_cs",
                     output_dir = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test")
```

This function opens a Shiny web page where you can click/unclick sections you'd like to include/exclude in the report (see descriptions below). It also renders one report for the specified measure.

## `render_report_multiple()`

Run `?render_report_multiple()` to see what each argument represents.

Example:

```
render_report_multiple(input_dir = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test",
                       templates = c("input_template_lebanon_cs.xlsx",
                                     "input_template_niger_psra.xlsx"),
                       output_dir = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test")
```

This function renders multiple reports at the same time.
