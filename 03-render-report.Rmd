# Generate the report

After carefully setting your parameters, you can now generate your report!

There are three ways to generate/knit reports:

1. Generate one report for one measure using the default settings `render_report()`

2. Generate one report for one measure using customized settings by the users `render_report_manual()`

3. Generate multiple separate reports for multiple measures using default settings `render_report_multiple()`

After generating the report, make sure to rename it and manually edit the sections that are text-heavy. The renaming is **necessary** because you may accidentally overwrite your manual edits if you regenerate the report in R.

Rmarkdown is not powerful yet to allow back-translation from Word to R codes, so your manual changes in Word will **NOT** be reflected in the R codes when you regenerate the report for some reasons (e.g. wrong file names). So we recommend finalizing the tables and plots before you write texts in the Word document (or you can just store the texts in another and move them over to the master report whenever you feel ready). If you've already written extensively in a knitted report and want to fix certain small sections/add some numbers, you can run the individual functions in R and manually make the changes.

**Note.** Error messages are shown in the knitted document in their corresponding section. They are usually about certain parameters not being specified. Other error messages should also be pretty understandable.

**Note.** Warning messages are not shown in the knitted document. They are usually okay to ignore as they often come from the `MplusAutomation` package failing to read certain bits of the Mplus output that are not quite important to generating the reports. They may also come from that WRMR is reported instead of SRMR due to Mplus version conflict. If it's telling you an error related to `xxx_fscores.csv`, simply ignore it (see this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nyuglobalties/mrautomatr/issues/20) for an explanation). You can also set `printwarning = TRUE` in rendering the reports (see the functions below) to have warnings printed in the documents too, or run `warnings()` in R to get all warning messages.


## `render_report()`

This function renders one report for the specified measure.

Run `?render_report()` to see what each argument represents. `parameters` allows you to specify a list of parameters to control the `params` section in the Rmarkdown template, you can omit this argument to use the default settings. See the bottom of this page for explanations on these parameters.

Example:

```
render_report(output_dir = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test",
              output_file = "Report_lebanon_cs.docx",
              parameters = list(
                       # set R code print options
                       printcode = FALSE,
                       printwarning = FALSE,
                       storecache = FALSE,

                       # set report overall parameters
                       template = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test/input_template_lebanon_cs.xlsx",
                       set_title = "Lebanon Year 1 (2016-2017)",
                       set_author = "Jane Doe",

                       # select report sections
                       item = TRUE,
                       descriptive = TRUE,
                       ds_plot = TRUE,
                       correlation_matrix_lg = TRUE,
                       correlation_matrix_bivar = TRUE,
                       correlation_matrix_item = FALSE, # BE CAREFUL! This might crash the document.
                       efa_screeplot = TRUE,
                       cfa_model_fit = TRUE,
                       cfa_model_plot = TRUE,
                       cfa_model_parameters = TRUE,
                       cfa_r2 = TRUE,
                       internal_reliability = TRUE,
                       summary_item_statistics = TRUE,
                       item_total_statistics = TRUE,
                       inv_tx = TRUE,
                       inv_gender = TRUE,
                       inv_age = TRUE,
                       inv_lg = TRUE
                       ))
```


## `render_report_manual()`

Run `?render_report_manual()` to see what each argument represents.

Example:

```
render_report_manual(output_file = "Report_lebanon_cs.docx",
                     output_dir = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test")
```

This function opens a Shiny web page where you can click/unclick sections you'd like to include/exclude in the report (see descriptions below). It also renders one report for the specified measure.

## `render_report_multiple()`

Run `?render_report_multiple()` to see what each argument represents. This function renders multiple reports at the same time with parameters globally set for all reports.

Example:

```
render_report_multiple(input_dir = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test",
                       templates = c("input_template_lebanon_cs.xlsx",
                                     "input_template_niger_psra.xlsx"),
                       output_dir = "/Users/michaelfive/Google Drive/NYU/3EA/test",
                       # set parameters globally for all documents
                       parameters = list(
                       # set R code print options
                       printcode = FALSE,
                       printwarning = FALSE,
                       storecache = FALSE,

                       # set report overall parameters
                       set_author = "Jane Doe",
                       # report title comes from the `year` tab in each excel template

                       # select report sections

                       correlation_matrix_lg = TRUE,
                       correlation_matrix_bivar = TRUE,
                       correlation_matrix_item = FALSE, # BE CAREFUL! This might crash the document.
                       efa_screeplot = TRUE,
